🎮 Game Description
Word-Grid is a browser-based word puzzle game inspired by the classic game Wordle. In this game, the player has a limited number of attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word. Each guess provides feedback via colored tiles:

🟩 Green: Correct letter in the correct position

🟨 Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position

⬜ Gray: Letter not in the word

The challenge is to guess the word using logic and deduction in as few tries as possible!

💡 Background
I chose to build Word-Grid because I’ve always enjoyed word games and wanted to recreate the challenge and fun of Wordle using my own code. It gave me a chance to practice logic implementation, DOM manipulation, and user feedback through interactive UI.
